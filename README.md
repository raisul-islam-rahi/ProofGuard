# 🛡️ Proof Guard — Warranty & Guarantee Tracker

Welcome to **Proof Guard**.  
This little project started from a simple need: we all buy products, and every time the warranty card or guarantee slip gets lost in some drawer. Proof Guard is my attempt to solve that problem in a clean, simple way — right inside your browser.

## ✨ What it does

- Add new warranties with product details, shop info, serial/model numbers, and notes  
- Keep track of **Active**, **Expiring Soon**, and **Expired** items in a neat dashboard  
- Search instantly by name, shop, serial, or PG ID  
- Export all your data to CSV, or import it back whenever you need  
- See your **Edit History** and restore deleted items from the **Trash**  
- Get reminders before expiry with notifications  
- Print warranty details in a clean format for records  
- All data stays **offline** in your browser’s local storage — nothing leaves your device

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling (responsive + light theme)  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for logic and data handling  
- **LocalStorage** for offline persistence
